    """I grew up in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV), love Valley life and its culture. I am passionate about many things including my family, design, education, my art and teaching. I majored in Graphic Design, graduating from the University of Texas-Pan American with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. Continuing my passion for learning and exploring, I moved to Tucson, AZ and received my MFA in Visual Communications from the University of Arizona. While in graduate school, I taught Art 265, a beginning level graphic design course, and am currently freelancing and teaching Typography (ARTS 2363) and Design I (ARTS 1311) at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

In my teaching, I strive to instill the responsibility of the designer within society as well as provide my students with the skills and knowledge needed to understand and produce good design; providing them with a solid foundation to become successful designers of the future. I’ve worked professionally, in the field of graphic design for about fifteen years as a Production Artist, Graphic Designer, Marketing Coordinator and Freelancer on both the East and West Coasts. Most recently, I lived in Virginia Beach, VA for about four years, before moving back to the RGV.

With my professional background as a designer and having grown up in the Valley, I have a great interest in the visual culture of the RGV. My current research includes the study of border culture through street and storefront signage, religious iconography and flea markets of the RGV. My recent work, Valley Cultura, is digital photomontage and mirrors my research using photographs I’ve taken over a period of ten years of the border area. It is as much a personal documentation and exploration of my struggle to find a place and connection within the Mexican culture and heritage as it is a visual account of the thriving culture unique to border areas of the United States."""
